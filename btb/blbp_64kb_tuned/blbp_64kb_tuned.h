/*
 * BLBP-style predictor, 64 KB, TUNED for our trace zoo -- the headline
 * configuration of the BLBP campaign. Identical machine and identical storage
 * to btb/blbp_64kb (same M, K, N, table geometry: the tuner mutates only
 * history intervals, the transfer curve and theta); only the constants differ.
 *
 * Provenance of the constants: parallel hill-climb over the 40 TRAINING
 * streams only (spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-blbp-design.md;
 * trajectory: cluster blbp_tune/gens/). Frozen at generation 35 of 40 with the
 * queue contended and per-generation gains below 0.2%: pooled train indirect
 * mispredicts 2,339,594 (paper constants) -> 1,929,199, a 17.5% reduction.
 * Test traces were never extracted into streams -- the tuner could not see
 * them by construction.
