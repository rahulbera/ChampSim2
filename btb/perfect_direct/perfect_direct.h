/*
 * group-BTB: CONDITIONAL, DIRECT_JUMP and DIRECT_CALL get their true target.
 * The indirect predictor and the RAS are left entirely real.
 *
 * One member of the per-group oracle family in inc/perfect_group/perfect_group.h,
 * which is where all the logic and every failure-mode guard live. This is a
 * configuration shell.
 *
 * Pair it with a REAL direction predictor (cbp6_tagescl64): the question is what
 * is left on a machine that predicts directions as well as we currently can.
 *
 * As with every oracle here, this module reports always_taken exactly as
 * basic_btb does, so it is safe underneath any direction predictor. See
 * btb/perfect_btb/perfect_btb.h for why that distinction matters.
