/*
 * Per-GROUP perfect-target oracles, for decomposing target headroom by the
 * microarchitectural structure that supplies the target.
 *
 * ChampSim routes every branch's target to exactly one of three structures
 * (btb/basic_btb/basic_btb.cc):
 *
 *   group-BTB   CONDITIONAL, DIRECT_JUMP, DIRECT_CALL   -> the BTB's stored target
 *   group-IBTB  INDIRECT, INDIRECT_CALL                 -> the indirect predictor
 *   group-RAS   RETURN                                  -> the return address stack
 *
 * Each oracle here gives the true target to ONE group and leaves the other two
 * entirely real, so the three are mutually exclusive and their headrooms can be
 * added. btb/perfect_indirect is the group-IBTB member of this family and
 * predates it; these two complete the set.
 *
 * ALL THREE PRESERVE BTB GATING, and that is the load-bearing design decision.
 * `direct.check_hit(ip)` runs before any routing, and on a miss basic_btb
 * returns "no prediction" for every group -- the BTB does not merely store
 * targets, it is also what tells the frontend that a PC is a branch at all and
 * what kind. An indirect branch that misses the BTB never reaches the indirect
 * predictor; a return that misses never reaches the RAS.
 *
 * The consequence is that these three do NOT sum to btb/perfect_btb, which has
 * no BTB whatsoever (it ignores the IP and returns the trace's target, so no
 * detection miss is possible). The difference is the BTB's DETECTION role:
 *
 *     perfect_btb = perfect_direct + perfect_indirect + perfect_return
 *                   + (branches the BTB never identified as branches)
 *
 * That residual is a real, separately interesting quantity -- it is what a
 * decoupled frontend's fetch-directed prefetching would attack -- and it is
 * measured by subtraction rather than assumed to be zero.
 *
 * ALIASING GUARD. The BTB indexes and tags on ip>>2 (direct_predictor.h), so two
 * branches within 3 bytes share an entry and a branch of the WRONG type can land
 * on a group's path. An earlier version of btb/perfect_indirect handed the true
 * target to whatever aliased in, which cut SPEC direct-jump MPKI from 0.1496 to
 * 0.0909 and inflated the very denominator the oracle exists to define. Each
 * oracle below therefore checks the instruction's REAL branch type before
 * answering, and otherwise behaves exactly as basic_btb would.

//
// `ideal_btb` is not a fourth group -- it is group-BTB's OTHER role. Measured
// on rubocop_w1, giving group-BTB perfect TARGETS is nearly worthless: direct
// jumps fall only 0.3668 -> 0.3552 MPKI where perfect_btb takes them to zero,
// because a direct branch's target never changes and the BTB's stored copy is
// already correct whenever the entry is present. What remains is the DETECTION
// role: entries that are not there at all. `ideal_btb` removes exactly that --
// it never misses, always knows the branch type, and has the right direct
// target -- while the REAL indirect predictor and REAL RAS still answer for
// their own groups. It therefore overlaps the other oracles by construction
// (un-gating hands them opportunities they did not previously get) and is
// reported alongside the decomposition, not as a term in it.
// The last two are the CUMULATIVE series: ideal_btb, then +perfect IBTB, then
// +perfect RAS. Nested rather than exclusive, so the increments telescope --
//     (s1-1) + (s2-s1) + (s3-s2) = s3-1
// which makes a stacked speedup chart legitimate where an exclusive split could
// not be drawn in speedup space at all. The last step should reproduce
// btb/perfect_btb exactly: detection perfect, direct targets from an infinite
// BTB (they never change), indirect perfect, returns perfect -- every target in
// the machine correct. That equality is the series' own correctness check.
//
// Attribution is ORDER-DEPENDENT: putting the BTB first credits the later steps
// with the un-gating benefit. Defensible because detection is genuinely prior in
// hardware -- it gates the other two -- but it must be stated, not assumed.
