/*
 * The CBP2016 TAGE-SC-L reference predictor (192KB budget), as shipped with the
 * CBP2025 framework, hosted in ChampSim.
 *
 * The predictor source under vendor/ differs from cbp2025/cbp2016_tage_sc_l_192kb.h
 * in exactly one line: PRINTSIZE is disabled, matching what upstream's own 64KB
 * sibling already does. Left enabled, the namespace-scope instance the header
 * declares prints a storage banner at static-init time in every simulator
 * binary, twice. See the comment at that line. Budget: 190.4 KB.
 *
 * All translation between ChampSim's module API
 * and the CBP6 interface lives in inc/cbp6/, so adding another CBP6 submission
 * means adding a directory, not porting code.
 *
 * SINGLE CORE ONLY. The vendored predictor keeps its tables in namespace-scope
 * globals rather than in the predictor object, so every instance would share
 * them. initialize_branch_predictor() throws if a second core tries to use it
 * rather than silently producing wrong results.
