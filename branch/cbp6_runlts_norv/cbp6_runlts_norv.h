/*
 * RUNLTS -- "Register-value-aware predictor Utilizing Nested Large TableS",
 * the CBP2025 (CBP6) winner by Koizumi et al. -- hosted in ChampSim.
 *
 * *** THIS IS NOT THE PREDICTOR THAT WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP. ***
 *
 * RUNLTS's headline contribution is a statistical-corrector component indexed by
 * a digest of recently produced architectural REGISTER VALUES, fed through
 * decode_notify()/execute_notify(). ChampSim traces carry register indices and
 * memory addresses but no register values, so that channel cannot be driven and
 * is left inert -- hence the _norv suffix. What runs here is RUNLTS minus its
 * distinguishing feature.
 *
 * The component degrades cleanly rather than breaking, and its inertness is
 * structural rather than merely observed: champsim::cbp6::host has no notion of
 * decode_notify()/execute_notify() and never calls them, so RegFileState entries
 * never become valid, register_values stays -1, the guard in predict() never
 * selects a register, and RBias contributes exactly nothing. Nothing asserts and
 * nothing looks wrong at runtime -- which is why the limitation is in the module
 * name. A result from this module must never be reported as "the CBP2025 winner".
 *
 * Measured cost of the missing channel, in CBP6's own simulator over 18 traces:
 * +6.33% MPKI, +0.84% CycWpPKI. See the design doc, section 2.1.
 *
 * Known defect in the submission, deliberately left as-is:
 * CBP2025_RUNLTS::TrackOtherInst forwards pred_dir and resolve_dir to the
 * implementation in swapped order. It is inert in both this adapter and the CBP6
 * framework because that path only ever carries unconditional branches, where
 * both are true. The protocol checker asserts that precondition rather than the
 * vendored source being patched.
 *
 * SINGLE CORE ONLY, as with the other CBP6 tenants: predictor state lives in
 * namespace-scope globals shared by every instance.
